Purpose for this web app

I experienced that repeating phase 1 was pretty awesome.I could solidify my basic ruby fundamentals and algorithm, but I was a bit tired physically and mentally.

So, I created this web app for cheering people who repeats phase 1 or phase 2 while studing in DBC. Repeating is not shameful and often recommended for good.

Basically, visitors may create an account and leave and comments for peers.
